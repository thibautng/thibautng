- 👋 Hi, I’m Thibaut Nguyen
- 👀 I’m now working in the data science field
- 🌱 I used to work as a sociologist and an urban planner for the past 15 years, and decided to extend my skills towards data science. I thoroughly enjoy manipulating datasets and learning programming languages
- 💞️ I’m always eager to explore new fields of knowledge, thus open to form new collaborations, as long as we share similar mindsets. So, please feel free to reach out to me.
- 📫 Here is my email address: thibaut.ng@gmail.com
